`--ci` now also writes `gl-code-quality.json`, a GitLab Code Quality report, next to `gribble.sarif` and `gribble-junit.xml`. `toCodeQuality(report)` is exported from `@gribble/core`. A new [GitLab CI](https://gribble.dev/docs/ci-gitlab) page shows the pipeline that feeds it to the merge request widget.
